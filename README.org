* Design Priorities

- performance: handles large documents (100M+ lines), 14kb, Unix-like snappiness
- buffer-oriented 
- multiplexed views ( for now, just panes. undecided on tabs)
- text selection: rectangular editing, multi cursor
- currently just ASCII. TBD on UTF-8, emojis and non-English languages.
- zero-dependencies 

* Components

- OryxBuffer: editor instance. only concerned w/ lines of text and how to render itself
- Mux: manages a set of Editor instances, and layout
